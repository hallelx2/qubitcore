# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QubitCore Platform Frontend is a comprehensive web application designed to showcase and provide access to QubitCore's quantum security solutions. This frontend serves as the primary interface for potential customers, developers, and enterprise clients to understand, evaluate, and integrate QubitCore's quantum-resistant security services across four main platforms: Shield (general security), Ledger (financial services), Synapse (AI/federated learning), and Aegis (healthcare).

The frontend must effectively communicate the quantum threat, demonstrate the value of quantum-resistant solutions, and provide seamless onboarding experiences for different user types - from individual developers exploring the free tier to enterprise decision-makers evaluating comprehensive security solutions.
